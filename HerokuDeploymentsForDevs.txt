Heroku Deployments for Node.JS

You will need:

1.) Git 1.7.11 or Higher with subtree support enabled.  To verify this, go to your friendly neighborhood command prompt and type:

git --version
git subtree

The Git version command should report 1.7.11 or higher, and the subtree command should provide you with help information.  If your Git version is below 1.7.11 or you see "git: 'subtree' is not a git command", please see the JenkinsHerokuMagic.txt file for details on upgrading Git and/or enabling the subtree command.

2.) Install the Heroku tool belt (works fine for Wheezy or Ubuntu 12.04)

3.) Review the the general instructions for setting up a Heroku Node.JS app as shown here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs  BUT, keep an eye out for one primary difference:  If your package.json file lives in a subdirectory of your Git project, you need to use the git subtree split with a temporary branch and then deploy the temporary branch like so:

    git subtree split --prefix=some/pathto/fix -b hdeploy
    git push heroku hdeploy:master

If your git project structure has package.json at the top level, follow the directions as usual and your app should deploy.
