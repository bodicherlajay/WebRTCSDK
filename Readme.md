# js-shared
This repository is intended to host reusable code components.

# Quick Start

* Prepare all dependencies: 
`$ npm install`
* Run Karma tests and keep watching for changes:
`$ grunt karma:unit` 
this is equivalent to doing:
`$ karma start karma.conf.js`
* Check style with JSLint:
`$ grunt jslint`
